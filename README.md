This project was created with the aim of creat a random 25 char key in hexadecimal(0-9, A-F).
It was for a friend of mine, but you can make a key with the lenght you want to. Blanks are defined in the "build/AffichageCle.c" file.

Keys are wrote in the "keys.txt" file. Everytime the programm is used, the key is wrote in this file (at the end).

To make all files needed to launch the program, use "make all".

To execute the program (Dynamic program in the "build/" directory), use "make execution" after the "make all".

If you want, a static one is usable in "build/" directory, named "ellieKey.static".

I am thanksfull to you for using my app and please, don't forget to put my nickname "Lesys" on files if you are sharing this.
